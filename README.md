### About Me

Hello! I'm a passionate Data Analyst with a strong curiosity for uncovering hidden insights and solving complex real-world problems. Though Iâ€™ve entered the field later than some, my drive and zeal for learning are relentless.

I have successfully completed Googleâ€™s Data Analytics and Advanced Data Analytics Courses on Coursera, equipping me with a solid foundation in:
âœ” Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
âœ” Sampling & Hypothesis Testing
âœ” A/B Testing & Confidence Intervals
âœ” Regression Analysis (Linear & Multi-Linear)
âœ” Machine Learning (Random Forest, XGBoost)

I am proficient in Python, R, SQL, and Tableau, allowing me to analyze data, build predictive models, and create compelling visualizations. My passion for discovery extends beyond dataâ€”I thrive on exploring patterns and uncovering insights that drive impactful decisions.
